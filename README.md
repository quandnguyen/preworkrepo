## User Stories
The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Custom font

## Video Walkthrough 

My walkthrough video is nothing but a black screen and cursor moving blindly.

## Notes

- Tutorial video went too fast. I had to rewind and pause soooo many times. 
- Would be nice to explain some fundamental concept like what's a function, what's a string, etc. I just did what the video told me to but I didn't really understand what I was doing. 
- This is the first time I saw additional features described above.
